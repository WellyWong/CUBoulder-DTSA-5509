This is a supervised learning project, seeking to predict the SalePrice, our target variable in the Ames Housing dataset, which is available at: https://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.txt

The Ames dataset is currently being use in a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques, which runs indefinitely with a rolling leaderboard.

My goal is to construct a predictive model that performs well, aiming for a score below 0.11, comparable to the top 100 leaderboard on Kaggle.
